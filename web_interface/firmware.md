## Firmware

The sources can be found at github: https://github.com/melexis/mlx-i2c-stick/mlx-i2c-stick-arduino

## Firmware installation

The boards you get from us(Melexis) for the MLX I2C STICK are pre-programmed.  
Meaning that this information is only needed when you buy yourself from off the shelve resources or you want to upgrade firmware.

### Instruction

To install a `UF2` file, you start with pressing both `RST` and `BOOT` button on the MCU at the same time, then release `RST` button, then moments later release also the `BOOT` button. Now a flash drive should appear and you can drag and drop (copy) the `UF2` file to the root of that drive. Once that is done, you are ready to use this interface!
